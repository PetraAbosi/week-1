    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <p>
        For the past few years, I have gotten the opportunity to develop myself in so many ways. I believe you should appreciate knowledge everyday and learn new things to better yourself for the tomorrow ahead. A few are some of the skills I have obtained:
        <ol>
            <li>Gained experience with Python, Java, R, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP</li>
            <li>Introduced to Enterprise Resouce Planning such as SAP, Odoo and Sentrifugo</li>
            <li>Developed blueprints for businesses based on their requirement specifications</li>
            <li>Communication skills such as Speaking in Public, Audio and video transcription and Sign Language interpretation</li>
            <li>Administrative experience such as filing and filling, organising and attending meetings and answering business calls.</li>
        </ol>
