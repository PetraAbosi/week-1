    <h1>Petra Abosi Mensah</h1>
    <p>I am the third born of the Abosi family and a member of the Lord's church. 
    <strong>I am from Ghana </strong>, the most peaceful country in Africa. 
    I am a student of the Ashesi University majoring in <strong>Management Information System</strong> because I wish to blend both <em>Information Technology and Economics 
    to solve real world problems</em> like Covid-19 and others.
    I am in the <strong>Class of 2022</strong> and will hopefully graduate in the year 2022. 
    I love to sing and dance. I admire beauty in all aspect of life. 
    I love learning new things and really love to share ideas and have lively discussions on any subject of interest.
    I am a Sign Language Enthusiast and I love advocating for the Deaf in society.
